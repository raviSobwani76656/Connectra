# Application Architecture Decision Framework

*A standard IT approach for selecting the right application architecture*

## 1. Objective

Establish a consistent, requirement-driven approach for selecting an application architecture using recognised IT standards, software engineering principles, and measurable evaluation criteria.

**Core principle:** Architecture must be driven by business requirements, non-functional requirements (NFRs), security obligations, and operational constraints—not personal preference, programming language, or technology trends.

**What not to base the decision on:** Do not choose an architecture because it is personally preferred, fashionable, widely discussed, or "the latest" technology; do not adopt microservices, serverless, or other complex patterns without a demonstrated requirement and a clear business or technical benefit.

## 2. Recognised references

- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:** Guidance for describing and documenting system architecture.
- **ISO/IEC 25010:** A software product quality model to help define and evaluate quality characteristics.
- **TOGAF:** An enterprise architecture framework for aligning architecture with business goals and governance.
- **NIST SSDF:** A framework for integrating secure development practices into the software development lifecycle.
- **C4 model:** A practical way to communicate architecture through context, container, component, and code diagrams.

Use the references proportionately to the application's size, risk, and regulatory obligations; no single framework prescribes the best architecture for every application.

## 3. Architecture decision process

1. **Business requirements:** Identify the purpose, users, business processes, and functional requirements.
2. **Non-functional requirements:** Define measurable expectations for security, performance, availability, reliability, maintainability, scalability, and recovery.
3. **Constraints and risks:** Evaluate budget, team skills, technology restrictions, integrations, compliance, data sensitivity, and hosting requirements.
4. **Architecture alternatives:** Identify and compare viable architecture patterns and technology options.
5. **Objective evaluation:** Score viable alternatives against weighted criteria, using evidence and documented assumptions.
6. **Decision and documentation:** Select the most suitable option, record the rationale and trade-offs, and obtain stakeholder approval.
7. **Validation:** Test high-risk assumptions through prototypes, performance tests, security assessments, or integration proofs of concept.

## 4. Architecture evaluation criteria

The weights below are an illustrative starting point. Set final weights based on the application's requirements, risk profile, and business priorities.

| Criterion | Example weight | Key question |
|---|---|---|
| Security and compliance | 20% | Can the application protect data and satisfy applicable obligations? |
| Maintainability | 20% | Can developers safely understand, test, and modify it? |
| Reliability and availability | 15% | Can it handle failures and meet uptime requirements? |
| Performance | 15% | Can it meet expected response times and workloads? |
| Scalability | 10% | Can it handle anticipated growth? |
| Development and operational cost | 10% | Is the total build, deployment, and maintenance cost acceptable? |
| Integration flexibility | 10% | Can it integrate reliably with required external systems? |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | |

### Weighted scoring method

```
Weighted Score = Σ [weightᵢ × (scoreᵢ / 5)]
```

Weight is expressed as a percentage and each architecture receives a score from 1 to 5 for each criterion. The result is a score out of 100.

> **Important:** These weights and scores are decision-support tools, not values prescribed by ISO. Mandatory security, privacy, and regulatory requirements must be pass/fail gates; a high overall score cannot compensate for a critical failure.

## 5. Selecting the appropriate architecture pattern

| Pattern | Suitable when | Main trade-offs |
|---|---|---|
| Layered architecture | Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access is useful. | Layers can become unnecessarily dependent if boundaries are weak. |
| Modular monolith | A cohesive application needs clear internal modules and straightforward deployment. | Components deploy together; module boundaries require discipline. |
| Microservices | Distinct capabilities need independent deployment, ownership, or scaling, and the organisation can operate distributed systems. | Higher infrastructure, monitoring, communication, and operational complexity. |
| Event-driven architecture | Workloads need asynchronous processing, event notifications, or loose coupling. | More complex event tracking, failure handling, and consistency. |
| Serverless architecture | Managed, event-triggered compute fits the workload and required controls. | Possible vendor dependency, execution constraints, and cost variability. |

**Recommended starting point:** Evaluate a modular monolith with clear architectural layers as an initial candidate—not as a mandatory rule. Introduce workers, event-driven processing, or microservices when requirements and evidence justify the added complexity.

## 6. Mandatory components of an architecture design

- **System context:** Users, external systems, integrations, and application boundaries.
- **Logical structure:** Modules, responsibilities, dependencies, and separation of concerns.
- **Data architecture:** Database design, relationships, ownership, validation, retention, backup, and migration.
- **Integration architecture:** APIs, protocols, external dependencies, timeouts, retries, and error handling.
- **Deployment architecture:** Hosting, infrastructure, networking, release strategy, and environment configuration.
- **Security architecture:** Authentication, authorisation, least privilege, trust boundaries, encryption, audit trails, and threat analysis.
- **Quality requirements:** Measurable performance, reliability, availability, maintainability, scalability, and recovery targets.
- **Testing strategy:** Unit, integration, end-to-end, security, and performance testing as applicable.
- **Operations and observability:** Logging, monitoring, alerting, incident response, backup, and disaster recovery.
- **Decisions and documentation:** Alternatives, rationale, trade-offs, risks, diagrams, API contracts, and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## 7. Organisational and financial considerations

- **Team structure and skills:** Choose an architecture the team can develop, operate, and support effectively.
- **Total cost of ownership (TCO):** Include development, infrastructure, licensing, monitoring, maintenance, training, and support.
- **Future change:** Plan for likely business growth without overengineering for hypothetical needs.
- **Vendor and technology dependency:** Evaluate portability, interoperability, licensing, and exit costs where relevant.
- **Compliance and governance:** Identify applicable legal, regulatory, contractual, and organisational controls before implementation.

Conway's Law is also a useful consideration: system boundaries and communication patterns should align sensibly with the organisation's teams and responsibilities.

## 8. Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

- **Context:** What requirement or problem requires a decision?
- **Options considered:** Which viable alternatives were evaluated?
- **Decision:** Which option was selected?
- **Rationale:** What evidence and criteria support the selection?
- **Consequences:** What benefits, limitations, costs, and risks follow?
- **Validation:** What tests or evidence are needed to confirm the decision?
- **Approval and review:** Who approved it, and what changes would trigger reconsideration?

## 9. Governance and review

Before implementation begins, review the architecture against:

- Business requirements and measurable quality targets.
- Mandatory security, privacy, and compliance requirements.
- Integration constraints, operational readiness, and total cost.
- Documented risks, trade-offs, and validation plans.
- Clear responsibilities for approval and future review.

Reassess the architecture when material changes occur in business requirements, workload, security risks, compliance obligations, or operational constraints.

## 10. Final recommendation

Adopt a requirements-driven architecture decision process supported by measurable quality criteria, structured comparison, risk assessment, and documented decisions. This provides a repeatable and transparent way to select an architecture that meets current needs while remaining maintainable and adaptable.

The goal is not to select the most advanced architecture; it is to select the architecture that best satisfies defined requirements at an acceptable level of risk and total cost.
